# redditVideoScraper
A bot collecting videos, compiling them and turning into a compilation video.


## Basic idea about the program i am going to write

Main target : 
 1. -> thumbnail generator. 
 2. -> compilation of videos from different subreddit. for example r/valorant or r/csgo ( gaming content), r/publicfreakout ( absurd content), r/someothersubreddit
 3. -> compilation of meme photos( who knows i might even have to create a meme classifier), extract text from images, convert text to speech, stich everything together to create video. 
 4. -> upload to youtube functionality
 
### What is the incentive
A bot that will upload videos to youtube. Around 5 per day( youtube api only allows upto 5 with it credit system).

### Todo

- [ ] finalize the libraries , that is going to be used.
- [ ] write some small test programs 

### Libraries that i might use

1. Praw ( python reddit API Wrapper)
2. gTTS 
3. ffmpeg-python
4. python tesseract 
5. QT python
